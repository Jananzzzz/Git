this is a doc of git features and notes.

when creating a repository in github, then you need to create a local repository to connect it.
here are the following steps you need to do in local: (after creating a repository in github)
1. create a local repository folder:
    a. in the windows command line, type:
    echo >> README.md  // this is windows instruction to create a new file in command line.
    b. then you will be asked to fill something in the file you created, just hit "Enter"
    c. if you don't want to add a README file, you can skip this step.
2. git branch -M main // you create a the first branch in you local repository.
3. git remote add origin https://github.com/Jananzzzz/Git.git  // connect your local repository to remote github repository
4. git remote // check the remote repository status, in this case it will show origin, which means the remote repository is on its origin branch,
   then, we will push the local repository to remote, this will break the origin status in the remote.
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "first commit"
7. git push -u origin main // push the local main branch to the remote origin branch, now the remote is on the main branch, which is also the origin branch.



Create a new branch:             git branch New_Branch_Name
Show all the branches:            git branch
Switch to a branch:              git checkout Branch_Name
After you create and Switch to a new branch, you should set the origin of the new branch in remote, then you can push changes to this new branch
the set origin command is:         git push --set-upstream origin FirstTestBranch

your local changes will be overwritten by checkout, please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches
